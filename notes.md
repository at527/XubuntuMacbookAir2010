# Macbook Air 2010 (3,2) Xubuntu 20 Install

## Basic Install

Everything seems to work ok with the standard install from a Xubuntu USB.
However, proprietary drivers are recommended.
While the Nouveau drivers work, they run very hot.

1. Install using flashed usb, include proprietary drivers
2. apt update and upgrade

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade
    ```
